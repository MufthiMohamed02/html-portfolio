   <h3>Solo Leveling</h3>
   <p> 
       Solo Leveling is set in a world where portals, called "gates," connect Earth to dungeons filled with monsters.
        Certain humans, known as "Hunters," possess powers to fight these monsters. 
        The story follows Sung Jin-Woo, a weak E-rank Hunter, who is known as the "world's weakest." After a near-death experience in a double dungeon, he gains the unique ability to "level up" like a game character, becoming stronger with each battle. As he grows in power, he uncovers deeper mysteries behind the gates, the Hunters, and the true forces manipulating their world.
        The anime focuses on Jin-Wooâ€™s rise from the weakest to the strongest, facing both personal and external challenges.
